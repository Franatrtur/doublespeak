#### Output

```
In a shocking finding, scientists discovered a herd of unicorns living in a remote, previously unexplored valley, in the Andes Mountains. Even more surprising to the researchers was the fact that the unicorns spoke perfect English.

"They're the first unicorns that we've found that are bilingual," said Andrea Martinez, a linguist at the University of Chile. "It's really remarkable that this language has been found so close to a common language. This is the first time we've found that these species are in harmony."

The research, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, could lead to the first true language-speaking unicorn, a hybrid of the European and the Chinese unicorns.

"It's not just the language, it's the ecology," said Taeh Yoo, a geneticist at the University of Chile. "The combination of these two traits makes this an incredible unicorn."
