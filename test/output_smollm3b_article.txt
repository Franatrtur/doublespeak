In a shocking finding, scientists discovered a herd of unicorns living in a remote, previously unexplored valley, in the Andes Mountains. Even more surprising to the researchers was the fact that the unicorns spoke perfect English. "It was one of the strangest things I have ever seen," says scientist Charles Stewart. "They seemed like they had just walked out of a fantasy novel. We knew that we had to do something to protect them, before they were completely destroyed."
What did the unicorns eat? That is still unknown, as the scientists were not allowed to leave the valley. But, it was suggested that they ate wild horses, camels, and llamas. It was also reported that the unicorns only left the valley at night to forage for food.
Why is it important to preserve this unique ecosystem? Well, we need to do our part to save these animals from extinction. "The world is changing rapidly," says Stewart. "We need to do everything we can to protect these animals, before it is too late."
The scientists are currently working on a plan to protect the unicorns, and their habitat.
